# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict diabetes risk based on various health indicators. The dataset contains medical attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts diabetes based on these features.

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `diabetes_dataset.csv`
- **Features Include:** Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Glucose Levels, HbA1c, Cholesterol, Family History, etc.
- **Target Variable:** `Outcome` (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
